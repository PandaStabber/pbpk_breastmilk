# From Mother To Child: Generic, Generational Pharmacokinetic 1-Box Model of the Transport of Pollutants in Breastmilk
This is a piece of code originally developed by Dr. Tenzing Gyalpo to support a publication. It has been adapted from Matlab, made generic, and is now hosted publicly to spur further development.

# Dependencies
The dependencies are listed in the 'requirements.txt' file and can be installed via pip in the terminal. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that many scientific Python libraries (e.g. `numpy`, `scipy`, `sklearn`, etc.) are included. 

Plotting is done with `matplotlib`, which can pose problems when deploying the model in a virtual environment. 

# Landing page
The landing page for this model is available [here](https://pandastabber.github.io/pbpk_breastmilk/)
